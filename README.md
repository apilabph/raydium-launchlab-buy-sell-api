# Raydium LaunchLab Buy and Sell API

Build unsigned buy and sell transactions for Raydium LaunchLab tokens before and after graduation to CPMM. Your bot keeps its keys and signs locally. This is an independent integration, not an official Raydium product.

**Beta 0.1.0.** Automated checks cover input, routing and fee safeguards. Funded trades have not been tested. A successful simulation is a point-in-time check, not a guarantee of execution. See [release evidence](docs/RELEASE.md) for the exact deployment and live verification status.

[API documentation](https://raydium-launchlab-trade.apilabph.workers.dev) · [OpenAPI](openapi.json) · [GitHub](https://github.com/apilabph/raydium-launchlab-buy-sell-api)

## Quick start

The hosted public beta requires no API key. Rate limits apply. Install Node 22 or 24 if using the local code.

```bash
curl https://raydium-launchlab-trade.apilabph.workers.dev/api/trade \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"publicKey":"YOUR_PUBLIC_WALLET","mint":"TOKEN_MINT","action":"buy","amount":"0.01","slippageBps":100,"maxServiceFeeBps":25}'
```

Replace the public wallet and token placeholders. The wallet needs SOL for input, gas and any account rent. This call returns an unsigned base64 transaction after simulation. Your bot must inspect, sign and submit it through its own RPC. The API never signs or broadcasts.

To sell, use `"action":"sell","amount":"1000000"`. Sell amounts are **raw token units**; buy amounts are decimal SOL strings. Use `/api/quote` with the same body for an estimate without constructing a transaction. Quotes are not simulated.

## What this builder checks

- The current curve stage, canonical destination and mint/program identity before construction, then the stage again after simulation.
- A single Jupiter route matching the verified market, exact input, minimum output, signer and fee account. Unknown route encodings are rejected.
- The service fee in the simulation's own inner transfer and swap event. Concurrent fee deposits cannot distort this check.
- Existing wrapped-SOL accounts are preserved. If one already exists, sell proceeds remain in wrapped SOL.

SOL-paired Raydium LaunchLab curves and their canonical Raydium CPMM migration pools. The original curve and destination are derived on chain. Legacy AMM migrations and unsupported Token-2022 extensions are rejected.

Migration-in-progress returns `MIGRATION_PENDING`. Rebuild after migration. New tokens may not yet be indexed by Jupiter; `ROUTE_UNAVAILABLE` does not mean the token is invalid. The API does not route through an unverified fallback.

## Fees

The service fee is **0.25% (25 basis points)**. On buys it is included in the requested SOL input; on sells it is deducted from actual SOL proceeds before the trader receives them. Fees are paid in wrapped SOL, atomically with the swap. Network and protocol fees are separate. If the fee receiving account does not exist, the first trader funds its rent; the response states the simulated rent separately.

Set `maxServiceFeeBps:25` to refuse a higher fee. A failed swap reverts the service transfer; the network may still charge its transaction fee. API calls alone do not earn trading fees. Forks of public code can change or remove the recipient.

## Run and maintain

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm test
npm run check
npm run build:check
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

Use `npx wrangler dev` with local-only `ACCESS_MODE="key"` and `API_KEY="your-local-password"` in ignored `.dev.vars`. These are self-hosting settings; hosted users do not need an issued API key. Configure `SOLANA_RPC_URL` and optional `JUPITER_API_KEY` as Worker secrets through secure stdin. Never commit credentials or wallet keys.

The hosted API uses an existing Helius project through a protected Worker secret; its quota is shared between these new Solana services. The default public Solana RPC is for development and can return 503 under shared limits. Cloudflare free CPU/request limits are shared with the owner's other Workers; no reserved capacity or latency SLA is offered. End-to-end build latency includes RPC and mandatory simulation. Confirmation latency additionally depends on your signing, RPC submission, priority fee and network conditions. No funded hosting upgrade is enabled.

The SDKs are used offline to generate fixed account layouts. After a protocol change, regenerate them, review the official source and route IDL, run tests and repeat read-only simulations. This API has no RapidAPI association.
